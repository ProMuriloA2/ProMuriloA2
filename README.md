# Repositories:

## Effective Software Fictitious Brand Website

This is a fictitious website for code demonstration. It is build with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 

This website simulates a company that sells software. It is, as shown in the tile, fictitious. The company shown in this website does not exist as it is portrayed in the code. The sole purpose of this code is to demonstrate code in order to show it in possible future job interviews.

## Murilo Code Blog
This is a repository for a front-end development project.
Murilo Code Blog is a front-end project developed in order to practice Front-End development and demonstrate code.
### Front-End Entry-Job Roadmap
The Front-End Roadmap page shows generic information about aspects of learning front-end development and information about which
topics someone has to study in order to get an entry-job knowledge of front-end development.

## Definitions_From_Txt

### All software inside this repository is under the GNU GPL V.3 License.

### This is a software for finding a lot of word definitions all at once
This is a linux terminal tool for automating word definition searchs. It uses gcide and it is adapted to search between many languages. In order to use it you must enter the text inside the enter_your_text_here.txt and run the ./dict_translator.sh. The whole process is shown below:

This Software works this way:

1. Copy and paste your text inside the enter_your_text_here.txt and save the file. Then you can close it.
2. Open the terminal in the folder and run: **chmod +x ./dict_translator** in the terminal
2. Open the terminal and execute the bash archive dict_translator. Run **./dict_translator.sh** in the terminal.
3. Now the software has been opened. Then choose a database based on the corresponding languages.
4. Now your definitions are available on the terminal and on the file **definitions_output.txt**.
5. Any errors while trying to find the definitions are in **errors_output.txt**.


## Math and Text Tools

1. Allow running ./calc.sh in your terminal by typing with all the software in the same folder:
chmod +x ./calc.sh
2. Press enter
3. Run ./calc.sh in your terminal by typing in :
   ./calc.sh
4. Press enter
5.  Interact with it there. A list is going to appear and you will be able to choose a tool.

#### Tool List:


##### BMI Calculator/ Calculadora de IMC

##### Temperature Conversion Calculator

The Temperature Conversion Calculator tells the user the temperature that the user inputs in another termic scale, as long as it is one of the following scales: Celsius, Kelvin and Fahrenheit.

##### Invert Whole Files

This algorithm inverts any text typed into a txt file.

##### Invert Words and Phrases

This algorithm inverts words and phrases.


##### Fibonnacci sequence test and generator

This algorithm verifies if the number typed is in the fibonacci sequence and it tells the user the fibonacci numbers preceding it.
